# OO Design: Deck of Cards


By [Tony Chung](http://www.github.com/tonycchung).

## Description

**Small project containing the necessary test to satisfy the following specs:**

```As a``` developer  

```I want``` to create a card with a particular suit and rank  

```So that``` I can build a deck with the created card.  

==
```As a``` player of a card game  

```I want``` a deck of 52 cards  

```So that``` I can play a standard game of cards.  


## Approach

Used BDD to first write tests to satisfy the above specs and utilized  
the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR process to write the code and pass the failing tests.
