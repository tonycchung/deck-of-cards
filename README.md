# OO Design: Deck of Cards

By [Tony Chung](http://www.github.com/tonycchung).

## Description

**A small project modeling a deck of cards built based on the following user stories:

As a developer  

I want to create a card with a particular suit and rank  

So that I can build a deck with the created card.  

==
As a player of a card game  

I want a deck of 52 cards  

So that I can play a standard game of cards.  


## Approach

Used BDD to first write tests to satisfy the above specs and went through
the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR process to write the code and pass the failing tests.
